# GitHub Job search and City Quality of Life project

This software finds GitHub job listings using GitHub's API and saves it to the user's search history. After the user has read through the listing, they have the option to check the Quality of life stats of said city using the Socrata API and/or to open the listing in their default browser to proceed with their job application. The application:

- Creates or finds the user from a database
- Asks the user to type in a city/keywords for the job listings
- Asks the user if they would like to store the current search in their profile
- Allows to select the particular listing
- Shows the listing with all HTML tags stripped
- Asks the user if they would like to view the city statistics
- Allows to open the job listing in the user's default browser
- Saves the data stats to the database for further use

Additionally:

- User is able to see their history or return to main menu/exit the app at almost any point
- Various text elements are in different colours for ease of use and readability
